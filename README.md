## API: Open Trivia Database

This game uses the **Open Trivia Database API** to fetch multiple-choice trivia questions in real-time. The Open Trivia API is a free, open-source API that provides trivia questions across various categories and difficulties.

### How the API is Used:
- **Endpoint**: The game sends a GET request to the APIâ€™s endpoint [Open Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=20&type=multiple) to fetch trivia questions.
- **Parameters**:
  - **amount**: This specifies the number of trivia questions to be retrieved. In this game, the default is set to 20 questions, but only one is used per round.
  - **type**: The type is set to `multiple`, which indicates that the API will return questions with multiple-choice answers (1 correct and 3 incorrect answers).

  ### Example API Response:
